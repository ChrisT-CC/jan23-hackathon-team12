## About
This interactive web application is designed to help the user save money through each banking transaction. The app rounds down the change to the nearest whole currency and deposits the amount in a separate 'piggy bank' linked to a bank account of their choice using the account's IBAN.

Clicking the 'login' button will prompt the user to enter their credentials (username and password) and pass through a two-factor authentication before arriving to their personal dashboard. There they will be able to view previous transactions, view the account balance and toggle between categorized piggy banks. 

### Target Audience
Piggy Bank is designed for users with access to a bank account who want to save money after each transaction. Adults and children alike can interact with this easy-to-use application and track their savings through one or more accounts.

## User Experience
Our team thought about various banking apps already in use today to consider what featues we wanted Piggy Bank to have. What features are current applications lacking? How could they be improved? What do we want the main functionality of Piggy Bank to be? 

Ultimately, we wanted an easy-to-use web application that allows the user to deposit, transfer and withdraw money safely and without issue. The simplicity of the app also caters to younger users and those who are just learning the ins and outs of online banking. 
​
### User stories
Four categories of User Stories were used to plan the implementation of various features for the Piggy Bank App. They were prioritized as: "Must Have", "Should Have", "Could Have" and "Won't Have". 

All categories of User Stories were included in the fnial deployment of this version of the Piggy Bank Application, barring those labeled "Won't Have". They were not prioritized during the creation and deployment of this version of the app but may be included as future features.

The image below shows a template to create User Stories that will include the name of the Story, a brief descritpion, its title, one of four labels and what team member the Story is assigned to.

## Design
​
### Color Scheme:
Our team decided on a royal blue color scheme with gray / silver accents to make it look professional yet entice users. The 5-color scheme is below.

### Typography:
<< what font pairings did your team consider and pick? And why? >>
<p style="color:red;font-size:18px;">Discuss w team</p>


### Imagery:
In the top, left corner of each page, a small piggy bank icon is shown. Clicking it will direct the user back to the home page.

​<img src="./media/favicon2.png" alt="White piggy bank icon with white dollar sign in a blue circular background">

To illustrate the Home Page, we used an image of a golden piggy bank with stacks of $100 bills next to it. The two buttons, 'Get Started' and 'Live Demo' are laid over the image along with the words, "Piggy Bank a safe way to save".

​
In the first stages of planning, one of our team members designed wireframes outlining the pages of our web application. 

Each page includes the Navigation bar at the top with the app logo, a login and a 'start saving' button.

The team wanted to include a page detailing how the Piggy Bank app works with a description of the app, the steps and a bottom section to find out more about the app and why users should try it.

​<img src="./media/how-works-wireframe.png" alt="How the app should work wireframe">

A page explaining why you should use Piggy Bank was included in the wireframe, too. This will show the benefits of using the app.

​<img src="./media/why-use-wireframe.png" alt="Wireframe explaining why customers should use Piggy Bank">

If a user wishes to sign up to use Piggy Bank, they can click on the 'Sign up' button in the nav bar and they'll be taken to a 'Create and account' page where they will need to fill out their user information to be able to log in to Piggy Bank. The information includes the user's full name, email address, a password (and confirmation of such), phone number and agreeing to the terms and conditions.

## Testing




## Deployment

### Elephant SQL and Heroku

The project was deployed on Heroku using the following steps...

1. Firstly, we created an elephant SQL team, invited all members there on their platform and gave them access to see the SQL database. 
    * As members, we made sure the project could run locally from each team member's gitpod first by installing django with tailwind and showing the team how to run it. 
2. Following this, each team member made their individual branches for developing the project. The projecct would then be developed until it was at a stage each team member was satisfied with, before being pushed to the main branch. 
3. Towards the end of the project, each team member then set up their configuration variables for the staging part of the deployment in the env.py file. This allowed the team to connect it to heroku which was created in Owen's account.
4. Finally, we tested everything on the staging branch before deploying the main branch for the project to be hosted on Heroku. 

### Github Pages

The project was deployed on Github Pages using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page), locate the "Settings" Button on the menu.
    - Alternatively Click [Here](https://raw.githubusercontent.com/) for a GIF demonstrating the process starting from Step 2.
3. Scroll down the Settings page until you locate the "GitHub Pages" Section.
4. Under "Source", click the dropdown called "None" and select "Master Branch".
5. The page will automatically refresh.
6. Scroll back down through the page to locate the now published site [link](https://github.com) in the "GitHub Pages" section.

### Forking the GitHub Repository

By forking the GitHub Repository we make a copy of the original repository on our GitHub account to view and/or make changes without affecting the original repository by using the following steps...

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. At the top of the Repository (not top of page) just above the "Settings" Button on the menu, locate the "Fork" Button.
3. You should now have a copy of the original repository in your GitHub account. 

### Making a Local Clone

1. Log in to GitHub and locate the [GitHub Repository](https://github.com/)
2. Under the repository name, click "Clone or download".
3. To clone the repository using HTTPS, under "Clone with HTTPS", copy the link.
4. Open Git Bash
5. Change the current working directory to the location where you want the cloned directory to be made.
6. Type `git clone`, and then paste the URL you copied in Step 3.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/
```

7. Press Enter. Your local clone will be created.

```
$ git clone https://github.com/
> Cloning into `CI-Clone`...
> remote: Counting objects: 10, done.
> remote: Compressing objects: 100% (8/8), done.
> remove: Total 10 (delta 1), reused 10 (delta 1)
> Unpacking objects: 100% (10/10), done.
```

### Content
To get an idea of pertinent User Stories for a savings app, we started by using a list of examples for the [UX on a mobile app](https://propelrr.com/blog/user-story-examples-fintech-apps#). From there we brainstormed other ways to improve the user experience and the Piggy Bank application itself.

A couple features were suggested as [user stories for mobile banking apps](https://blog.requstory.com/2021/12/06/user-stories-for-mobile-banking-app/) but were included as "Won't Have" user stories. They are features we could include in subsequent versions of the application.
​
### Media
To learn how the deposit, transfer and withdraw features would work for our application, we found and followed a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrT9Wf_OFyw) that showed us how to write our desired functions for our logic. We used that as a template to develop our own functions so the features we wanted in Piggy Bank would work.
​
### Acknowledgements
We would like to acknowledge and thank each member of our team for great team work and participation during this hackathon. As is customary for hackathons, our team comprised individuals of different coding levels but each member was able to contribute to the final project and development of our Piggy Bank app.

Thanks also to the hackteam and Code Institute. We appreciate your volunteering your time and expertise to help with any questions and clarifications we had throughout the project.
