## About
This interactive web application is designed to help the user save money through each banking transaction. The app rounds down the change to the nearest whole currency and deposits the amount in a separate 'piggy bank' linked to a bank account of their choice using the account's IBAN.

Clicking the 'login' button will prompt the user to enter their credentials (username and password) and pass through a two-factor authentication before arriving to their personal dashboard. There they will be able to view previous transactions, view the account balance and toggle between categorized piggy banks. 

### Target Audience
Piggy Bank is designed for users with access to a bank account who want to save money after each transaction. Adults and children alike can interact with this easy-to-use application and track their savings through one or more accounts.

## User Experience
Our team thought about various banking apps already in use today to consider what featues we wanted Piggy Bank to have. What features are current applications lacking? How could they be improved? What do we want the main functionality of Piggy Bank to be? 

Ultimately, we wanted an easy-to-use web application that allows the user to deposit, transfer and withdraw money safely and without issue. The simplicity of the app also caters to younger users and those who are just learning the ins and outs of online banking. 
​
### User stories
Four categories of User Stories were used to plan the implementation of various features for the Piggy Bank App. They were prioritized as: "Must Have", "Should Have", "Could Have" and "Won't Have". 

All categories of User Stories were included in the fnial deployment of this version of the Piggy Bank Application, barring those labeled "Won't Have". They were not prioritized during the creation and deployment of this version of the app but may be included as future features.

The image below shows a template to create User Stories that will include the name of the Story, a brief descritpion, its title, one of four labels and what team member the Story is assigned to.

## Design
​
### Color Scheme:
Our team decided on a royal blue color scheme with gray / silver accents to make it look professional yet entice users. The 5-color scheme is below.

### Imagery:
In the top, left corner of each page, a small piggy bank icon is shown. Clicking it will direct the user back to the home page.

​<img src="./media/favicon2.png" alt="White piggy bank icon with white dollar sign in a blue circular background">

To illustrate the Home Page, we used an image of a golden piggy bank with stacks of $100 bills next to it. The two buttons, 'Get Started' and 'Live Demo' are laid over the image along with the words, "Piggy Bank a safe way to save".

​
In the first stages of planning, one of our team members designed wireframes outlining the pages of our web application. 

Each page includes the Navigation bar at the top with the app logo, a login and a 'start saving' button.

The team wanted to include a page detailing how the Piggy Bank app works with a description of the app, the steps and a bottom section to find out more about the app and why users should try it.

​<img src="./media/how-works-wireframe.png" alt="How the app should work wireframe">

A page explaining why you should use Piggy Bank was included in the wireframe, too. This will show the benefits of using the app.

​<img src="./media/why-use-wireframe.png" alt="Wireframe explaining why customers should use Piggy Bank">

If a user wishes to sign up to use Piggy Bank, they can click on the 'Sign up' button in the nav bar and they'll be taken to a 'Create and account' page where they will need to fill out their user information to be able to log in to Piggy Bank. The information includes the user's full name, email address, a password (and confirmation of such), phone number and agreeing to the terms and conditions.

### Testing User Stories from User Experience (UX) Section

-   #### First Time Visitor Goals

    1. As a First Time Visitor, I want to easily understand the main purpose of the site and learn more about the organisation.

        1. Upon entering the site, users are automatically greeted with a clean and easily readable navigation bar to go to the page of their choice. Underneath there is a Hero Image with Text and a "Learn More" Call to action button.
        2. The main points are made immediately with the hero image
        3. The user has two options, click the call to action buttons or scroll down, both of which will lead to the same place, to learn more about the organisation.

    2. As a First Time Visitor, I want to be able to easily be able to navigate throughout the site to find content.

        1. The site has been designed to be fluid and never to entrap the user. At the top of each page there is a clean navigation bar, each link describes what the page they will end up at clearly.
        2. At the bottom of the first 3 pages there is a redirection call to action to ensure the user always has somewhere to go and doesn't feel trapped as they get to the bottom of the page.
        3. On the Contact Us Page, after a form response is submitted, the page refreshes and the user is brought to the top of the page where the navigation bar is.

    3. As a First Time Visitor, I want to look for testimonials to understand what their users think of them and see if they are trusted. I also want to locate their social media links to see their following on social media to determine how trusted and known they are.
        1. Once the new visitor has read the About Us and What We Do text, they will notice the Why We are Loved So Much section.
        2. The user can also scroll to the bottom of any page on the site to locate social media links in the footer.
        3. At the bottom of the Contact Us page, the user is told underneath the form, that alternatively they can contact the organisation on social media which highlights the links to them.

-   #### Returning Visitor Goals

    1. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the new programming challenges or hackathons.

        1. These are clearly shown in the banner message.
        2. They will be directed to a page with another hero image and call to action.

    2. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the best way to get in contact with the organisation with any questions I may have.

        1. The navigation bar clearly highlights the "Contact Us" Page.
        2. Here they can fill out the form on the page or are told that alternatively they can message the organisation on social media.
        3. The footer contains links to the organisations Facebook, Twitter and Instagram page as well as the organization's email.
        4. Whichever link they click, it will be open up in a new tab to ensure the user can easily get back to the website.
        5. The email button is set up to automatically open up your email app and autofill there email address in the "To" section.

    3. As a Returning Visitor, I want to find the Facebook Group link so that I can join and interact with others in the community.
        1. The Facebook Page can be found at the footer of every page and will open a new tab for the user and more information can be found on the Facebook page.
        2. Alternatively, the user can scroll to the bottom of the Home page to find the Facebook Group redirect card and can easily join by clicking the "Join Now!" button which like any external link, will open in a new tab to ensure they can get back to the website easily.
        3. If the user is on the "Our Favourites" page they will also be greeted with a call to action button to invite the user to the Facebook group. The user is incentivized as they are told there is a weekly favourite product posted in the group.

-   #### Frequent User Goals

    1. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any newly added challenges or hackathons.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the banner message.

    2. As a Frequent User, I want to check to see if there are any new blog posts.

        1. The user would already be comfortable with the website layout and can easily click the blog link

    3. As a Frequent User, I want to sign up to the Newsletter so that I am emailed any major updates and/or changes to the website or organisation.
        1. At the bottom of every page their is a footer which content is consistent throughout all pages.
        2. To the right hand side of the footer the user can see "Subscribe to our Newsletter" and are prompted to Enter their email address.
        3. There is a "Submit" button to the right hand side of the input field which is located close to the field and can easily be distinguished.

### Further Testing

-   The Website was tested on Google Chrome, Internet Explorer, Microsoft Edge and Safari browsers.
-   The website was viewed on a variety of devices such as Desktop, Laptop, iPhone7, iPhone 8 & iPhoneX.
-   A large amount of testing was done to ensure that all pages were linking correctly.
-   Friends and family members were asked to review the site and documentation to point out any bugs and/or user experience issues.

### Known Bugs

-   On some mobile devices the Hero Image pushes the size of screen out more than any of the other content on the page.
    -   A white gap can be seen to the right of the footer and navigation bar as a result.
-   On Microsoft Edge and Internet Explorer Browsers, all links in Navbar are pushed upwards when hovering over them.

## Credits

### Code
<< any and all code that isn't yours...must go here >>
<p style="color:red;font-size:26px;">Team, did we use any code snippets?</p>

​
### Content
To get an idea of pertinent User Stories for a savings app, we started by using a list of examples for the [UX on a mobile app](https://propelrr.com/blog/user-story-examples-fintech-apps#). From there we brainstormed other ways to improve the user experience and the Piggy Bank application itself.

A couple features were suggested as [user stories for mobile banking apps](https://blog.requstory.com/2021/12/06/user-stories-for-mobile-banking-app/) but were included as "Won't Have" user stories. They are features we could include in subsequent versions of the application.
​
### Media
To learn how the deposit, transfer and withdraw features would work for our application, we found and followed a [YouTube video](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=SrT9Wf_OFyw) that showed us how to write our desired functions for our logic. We used that as a template to develop our own functions so the features we wanted in Piggy Bank would work.
​
### Acknowledgements
We would like to acknowledge and thank each member of our team for great team work and participation during this hackathon. As is customary for hackathons, our team comprised individuals of different coding levels but each member was able to contribute to the final project and development of our Piggy Bank app.
